# DREAM Donut.
DREAMWeek2018

This app was developed for Dream Week 2018 by Ricardo Amaya as part of a social experiment designed to expose the user to the injustices of judging the value and worth of a human being by the initial conditions of their birth.

The app asks the user for their birthdate then evaluates the day of the week on which they were born to determine wether or not the user is entitled to a donut.
If the user was born on:
-Monday
-Wednesday
-Friday
-Sunday
Then the user will get a donut. Otherwise the user will get nothing

It is the developer's hope that this app can open the imagination of the user and allow them to experience the systematic discrimination that DACA recipents, TPS recipients, and other undocumented people experience every day.
